Hi, I'm James, and I'm a project manager in recovery.

<i>Hi, James!</i>

After 15 years in the tech world, a visit to the hospital convinced me that I should slow down a bit. So, since 2015, I've been working odd jobs all over the country. I've been a gardener, a farmer, a mechanic, and most recently, a pizza delivery guy. 

But I always seem to come back to tech.

I'm always the guy trying new things on my computer, new setups, and just poking and prodding at the latest ideas. As a tinkerer, not as a serious job. 

But I've been thinking... 

Why not jump in again? Roll the dice, and see if I can pave my own way in the tech world again? Definitely not in management, but getting back to my roots. Thanks to the UIUC's HTML primer, I started website development waaaay back in 1996. Hosted my first site on Tripod. I coded websites for a small college through my own college years, and once I graduated, I went into IT management.

Big mistake.

So I'm going back to where I started. I'll be taking lessons through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> and once that's complete, the <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">Full Stack Open</a> from the University of Helsinki. I plan on documenting my progress, successes, failures, and frustrations here for family and friends to keep up with.

Come along, now! Let's see if tech can be fun again!
