## The creative side of development

While code is the backbone of the web, design is its face. The tools that have been created to lay out websites have developed quite a bit since I last coded, and from what I can see, they’ve developed for the better. Flexbox and Grid help immensely with logical, clean design. (Can you tell that I’m a big fan of the minimalist, Swiss design?) 

Before, I had to guess at the resolution the end user was using to lay out our site. I had to take wild ass guesses at where things were on the end user’s screen. Was an element going to load in the top right corner, or was it going to fall off under the title image? Worse than that, however, was having to design for Internet Explorer as well, who had a funny <em>interpretation</em> of standards.

Thankfully, the bulk of that is behind us. Browsers have tightened up their support of standards, and with the advent of responsive design, you can display the same information on phone, laptop, or desktop.
