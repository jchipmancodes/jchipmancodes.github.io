One of the things about taking classes is that you have to practice the trade in order to fully understand what you're learning. It's not just coding, specifically, but anything you want to learn. "How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice."

In that vein, I'm changing my trajectory a bit, taking some time off of studying to hone what I've learned so far. A quick Google search for "simple html css projects" led me to the MakeUseOf's [article](https://www.makeuseof.com/html-css-projects-beginners/) of some basic assignments you can do to hone your skills and fill your portfolio.

I've started on one, the [Tribute page](https://jchipmancodes.github.io/projects/HTML_and_CSS/TributePage/index.html). It's super basic and super simple, but it really made me think of how the box model of CSS works. It scales... okay, but, to really do modern web design, you need the tools of fluxbox and grid to go with it. But as a simple page to get my hands dirty, it works.

Next up is going to be a mockup of a video sharing site, ala: YouTube. With what I've learned from the Tribute page, and what I'm also learning from Flux Academy's [Free Web Design Course]{https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXC_gcsKLD6n7p6tHPBxsKjN5hA_quaPI}, I feel like it's going to be a much better exercise.
