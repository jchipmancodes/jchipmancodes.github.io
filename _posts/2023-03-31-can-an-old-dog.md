After a few weeks poking around in the Odin Project, I feel like I've gotten up to speed in the world of HTML and CSS. It's markup language, not much has changed over the years. A quick Google search brings up HTML 5.0 being released in 2008, just a few years after I got out of coding, and CSS 3.0... well, that was originally released in 1999.

JavaScript may be a problem. Never touched it, as I didn't have any server space that would allow me to run scripting languages. I did C++ and Java back in college, so I have the fundamentals of OOP down, just not the syntax. Just screwing around with it though, I could solve FizzBuzz no problem.

What could be a problem though, is that I'm 41, and haven't sat in front of an IDE in ages. I like the progress made, though. Playing with it is one thing, but I want to be functional in something by the end of the year. That means practice. Lots and lots of practice. So along with TOP and fullstackopen, I'll be working on side projects to hone my skills. We'll see what happens.
