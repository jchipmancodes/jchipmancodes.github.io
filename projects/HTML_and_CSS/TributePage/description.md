A tribute page is a single-page website outlining the qualities of someone you consider an idol or role model. This project only requires fundamental HTML and CSS skills and is one of the simplest tasks you can use to showcase your abilities.

A tribute page's most prominent feature is the subject's picture. As such, proper positioning of this image requires technical skills, design skills, and an eye for detail. You must choose the right background colors to complement the image.

The subject's name is just as important as the image, often highlighted with unique fonts and colors in the header. In addition, a tribute page contains one or two paragraphs about the subject, links, and public contact information.
