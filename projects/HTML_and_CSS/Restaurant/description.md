A restaurant website must use the right combination of colors to make food and drinks look more appealing to customers. You can also make the website interactive to increase customer engagement. For example, hovering over a mealâ€™s image can display a menu card containing the price and availability.

This project provides an opportunity to challenge your layout skills. For instance, you can use image sliders to showcase the restaurant's menu options. Alternatively, you can use CSS grid or flexbox to align the food items. Simple animations on buttons and images can also give your website an exciting look.

A restaurant website may require skills beyond simple HTML and CSS, such as jQuery and @keyframes.
