A survey form project will test your knowledge and proficiency in interactive controls. It covers the full range of UI/UX, including receiving and submitting user input. Furthermore, you will use HTML elements like radio buttons, text fields, checkboxes, and labels in this project.

Your survey form does not need to ask real-life questions or store responses in a database. Instead, you can use placeholder text to demonstrate your command of proper webpage structure. Furthermore, you can make a responsive form that adjusts its contents based on screen size.
