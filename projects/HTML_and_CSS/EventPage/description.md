At first glance, an event page seems like any static webpage project on this list. However, its defining feature is a register button for visitors interested in attending the event. Another standout feature is links for the venue, itinerary, and speakers.

This project tests your ability to fit a lot of information into a limited space. Consequently, your webpage must clearly state the event's purpose and benefits, if applicable. You can also include relevant images of the venue, speakers, and event theme.

An event page requires you to know how to use HTML and CSS to partition your page into sections. In addition, the header should contain an interactive menu, and the footer should display supplementary information.
