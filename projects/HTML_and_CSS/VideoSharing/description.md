A website clone is often considered the ultimate test of your HTML and CSS skills, taking more time and effort to complete than any other project. Video-sharing sites like YouTube and Netflix are popular candidates for website cloning due to their complexity and professional look.

The cloning process begins with screenshots of the websiteâ€™s user interface, particularly the interactive elements. Then, you use all the skills at your disposal to replicate the look and feel of the various parts of the website.

Your clone site should include features like search engines, comment sections, channels, and payment plans. You can also embed an HTML5 video background to mimic the video-playing functionalities of these websites.

This project provides an insight into the thought process of large, professional web development teams. What's more, you can use the Inspect tool on your web browser to peek at the HTML and CSS source code for these sites.
